# Tertestrial Release Notes

- links to [Atom package](https://github.com/charlierudolph/tertestrial-atom)
- the setup wizard is now run via a command (`tertestrial setup`) instead of a switch (`tertestrial --setup')

- server does not terminate on errors at runtime anymore, but prints visible error messages
- action sets can be switched by name in addition to number now
